[Community Science Museum](https://cv-semester-project-1.netlify.app/) is a fictional science museum website that I built for my semester project during my first year of Front-End Development at Noroff.

## Description

Community Science Museum is a fictional science museum website that I designed and built for my semester project during my first year of Front-End Development at Noroff.

**The brief for the assignment stated that:**
The website's primary audience consists of children aged 7-15 and families with young children. It aims to be informative and attractive, appealing to both middle school students and their parents. The website should cater to the audience's curiosity and intelligence, presenting information in an engaging manner. Its goal is to encourage visitors to explore the museum, and it must be responsive and user-friendly across different devices.

I made the design and wireframes in Figma, followed by building a fully responsive website using HTML and CSS.
